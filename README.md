# RLBotPack
A collection of ready-to-use bots made by the community.

The RLBotPack is a repository holding frequently requested bots in one convenient place. The main intended users are people joining the discord looking for a fun bot to try out. It may also be useful as a way for people running streams to get an up-to-date version of your bot.

To be a part of the pack, you just need to create a pull request with your bot to this repository.

To qualify:
 - Your bot must be capable of auto-run
 - Use Python or Rust? You're all set.
 - Other languages? We have a [Java wiki](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample/wiki/Auto-Launching-Java), a [C# wiki](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotCSharpExample/wiki/Auto-Launching) and a [Scratch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oK44syo49Y).
- Your bot must not have any crazy external requirements (except for very common ones like Java or Google Chrome)
- You must be willing to trim out any extra bot configs from your folder that people wouldn't care about
- **If you join the bot pack, people will be free to play against you for rank in the [braacket league](https://braacket.com/league/rlbot) whenever they want!**

After you create the pull request, somebody will come along, review your bot and eventually merge it to the pack.
